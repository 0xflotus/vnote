[VNote](https://tamlok.github.io/vnote) is a Vim-inspired note-taking application that knows programmers and Markdown better. VNote provides fancy Markdown experience as well as powerful notes management.

VNote is **open source** and currently mainly developed and maintained by one single person in spare time. Hence, please don't hesitate to give VNote a hand if she does improve your productivity.

## Troubleshooting Guide
1. Go through the context menu, menu bar, tool bar, settings, and help menu to check if you miss something;
2. Changes to configuration may need re-opening current tabs or restarting VNote;
3. There is a Markdown guide and shortcuts guide in the help menu, which might be helpful;
4. Do a quick search in [Github Issues](https://github.com/tamlok/vnote/issues) and VNote's [Documentation](https://vnote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/);
5. Post an issue *in detail* on Github to ask for help.

<mark>One More Thing</mark>: If you do not know what is Vim, please do not turn on Vim mode in the settings dialog. üòÅ By the way, Vim is really a magic tool to improve edit efficiency. Highly recommend Vim mode and VNote's shortcuts. You won't regret it.

Now, how about pressing `Ctrl+G` and start today's work from **Universal Entry**?

Have fun!

# VNote Themes
VNote supports themes. A theme is a folder in the subfolder `themes` in VNote's configuration folder. The best way to make a custom theme is to download the default themes [here](https://github.com/tamlok/vnote/tree/master/src/resources/themes), rename related files, put them in the theme folder, and tune it to your taste.

A restart is needed to detect or apply a new theme.

For detailed information about a theme, please visit [VNote](https://github.com/tamlok/vnote).
